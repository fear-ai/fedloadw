# GitHub Workflow Documentation

## Branch Structure

### Main Branches
- `main` - Production branch
  - Always stable and deployable
  - Protected branch with required reviews
  - Only updated through releases or hotfixes
  - Requires passing CI checks
  - No direct pushes allowed

- `develop` - Development branch
  - Integration branch for features
  - Contains latest delivered development changes
  - Protected branch with required reviews

### Supporting Branches
- `feature/*` - Feature branches
  - Branch from: `develop`
  - Merge back to: `develop`
  - Naming convention: `feature/feature-name`
  - Example: `feature/pdf-extraction`

- `release/*` - Release preparation branches
  - Branch from: `develop`
  - Merge back to: `develop` and `main`
  - Naming convention: `release/vX.Y.Z`
  - Example: `release/v1.0.0`

- `hotfix/*` - Emergency fixes
  - Branch from: `main`
  - Merge back to: `main` and `develop`
  - Naming convention: `hotfix/description`
  - Example: `hotfix/security-patch`

## Workflow Processes

### Feature Development
1. Create feature branch from develop:
   ```bash
   # Linux/Mac (Bash) and Windows (PowerShell) - same commands
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Develop and commit changes:
   ```bash
   # Linux/Mac (Bash) and Windows (PowerShell) - same commands
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: description of changes"
   ```

3. Push to remote:
   ```bash
   # Linux/Mac (Bash) and Windows (PowerShell) - same commands
   git push -u origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

4. Create pull request to develop
5. Wait for CI checks and reviews
6. Merge after approval

### Release Process
1. Create release branch:
   ```bash
   # Linux/Mac (Bash) and Windows (PowerShell) - same commands
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   git checkout -b release/vX.Y.Z
   ```

2. Update version numbers and documentation
3. Create pull request to main
4. Wait for CI checks and reviews
5. Merge to main after approval
6. Create version tag:
   ```bash
   # Linux/Mac (Bash) and Windows (PowerShell) - same commands
   git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release vX.Y.Z"
   git push origin vX.Y.Z
   ```

7. Merge back to develop:
   ```bash
   # Linux/Mac (Bash) and Windows (PowerShell) - same commands
   git checkout develop
   git merge release/vX.Y.Z
   git push origin develop
   ```

### Hotfix Process
1. Create hotfix branch:
   ```bash
   # Linux/Mac (Bash) and Windows (PowerShell) - same commands
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b hotfix/description
   ```

2. Fix the issue and commit:
   ```bash
   # Linux/Mac (Bash) and Windows (PowerShell) - same commands
   git add .
   git commit -m "fix: description of fix"
   ```

3. Create pull requests to both main and develop
4. Wait for CI checks and reviews
5. Merge after approval

## CI/CD Pipeline

Verify the current Git configuration and status:
```bash
git status
```

Check the remote repository configuration:
```bash
git remote -v
```

**Git Configuration Recommendations**:

   **Branch Setup**:
   ```bash
   # Create development branch
   git checkout -b develop
   ```
   # Create feature branch template
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/template
   git push -u origin feature/template
   ```

**GitHub Workflow Setup**:
   - Create `.github/workflows` directory
   - Add CI/CD workflows for:
     - Python testing
     - Code linting
     - Security scanning

**Repository Settings** (in GitHub UI):
   - Set up issue templates
   - Configure pull request templates
   - Enable GitHub Actions
